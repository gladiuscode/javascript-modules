# packagers

This project showcases webpack as one of the solutions to unlock modules power in web development.

We can build our application under the /src folder and then, through this command:

```bash
yarn && yarn run build
```

We can let webpack do its magic and generate a /dist folder with the bundled application.
To finish the process, we must move our index.html file to the /dist folder and open it in a browser.
